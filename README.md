# Advertising market
The concept of advertising dates back to early human history when people started to trade assets between local communities. Merchants used signs and symbols to advertise their good and more advanced civilizations like the Egyptians used papyrus to make sales posters. The concept of advertising, even though many years have elapsed since its origin, it stayed relatively the same, but the medium has dramatically changed.

In marketing it’s possible to highlight a trend: or one’s adapt to new advertising standards or one is out. In the past 20 years we saw a transition from TV commercials, massive outdoors and other physical media to the digital world. Nowadays, top concerns in advertising are user data handling, user immersion and some other user friendly policies, so in short, now the market is strongly user-centered.

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)
In order to calculate digital advertising Total Addressable Market (TAM) we considered the following criterium:
- Person that uses a smartphone or computer &
- Uses at least one social media app &

We estimated a TAM of 6.4bn potential users.
More specifically we could dive into decentralized social media TAM and find a TAM of about 1.5bn users.

# The problem: Every ad is just the same
It's easy to notice how there's a standardization in the way advertisements are produced nowadays, with the majority being composed of short videos that attempt to capture users' attention in just a few seconds. This results in ads being passive to customers, lacking immersion and interactivity, thus making it challenging to capture the attention of the target audience.

Furthermore, there is a significant growth in investment in the marketing and advertising market, as competition intensifies for users' attention, as revealed by the graph below, which depicts the growth in billions of dollars invested in social media advertising over the years.

With the increase in investments, there is also an evident rise in the number of ads users are exposed to, as indicated by research from the PPC Project and Red Crow Marketing. The number of ads seen per day by an individual in the 1970s averaged around 500-1600, while in 2021, this figure ranged from 6000-10000. Based on these values, the following graph illustrates the average number of ads a person is exposed to per day in a given year.

What is currently evident is an inundation of advertisements that are strikingly similar across all platforms, compounded by one of the most debated and contemplated topics in the current century: data security. Due to the market saturation in marketing, companies are increasingly aiming to deliver targeted and specific ads to each customer, which involves the need to acquire data regarding the particular consumption preferences of individual users. All of this gives rise to a significant issue within the marketing industry.

# Farcaster Ads: The optimal solution 
The core concept of Farcaster Ads revolves around crafting advertisements that are not only interactive and entertaining but also engaging and practical, effectively grabbing the attention of users. This approach is designed to revolutionize the way brands connect with their audience, making the advertising experience significantly more rewarding for both parties.

Farcaster Ads revolutionizes user engagement by offering interactive ads that prompt users to participate actively through quizzes, games, or immersive experiences. This fosters a deeper connection between consumers and brands. Moreover, advertisers receive instant feedback on consumer responses, allowing for the real-time optimization of campaigns and enhancing overall efficiency.

The interaction with these ads injects fun into the advertisement experience, incorporating elements of surprise and humor. This transforms the ad from a potential annoyance into an enjoyable and valuable experience. The ads themselves are visually captivating and tailored to meet the user's specific needs, significantly boosting receptivity and increasing the likelihood of converting viewers into customers.

In the ever-evolving landscape of digital marketing, the Cost per Lead (CPL) emerges as a pivotal metric for gauging the efficacy of advertising campaigns. For ad platforms, a deep understanding of CPL is fundamental not just for refining strategies but also for maximizing investment returns and delivering cutting-edge solutions tailored to the unique demands of businesses within the same industry. This strategic focus transcends merely boosting the effectiveness of ad campaigns; it fosters robust competition, thereby catalyzing growth and enhancing profitability in the fiercely competitive digital marketplace.

A study conducted by WordStream in 2023 sheds light on the prevailing CPL trends, revealing that the average CPL for Facebook ads stands at $23.10, in stark contrast to Google Ads, which averages at $53.52. This discrepancy can largely be attributed to Facebook's more engaging and interactive ad formats, offering a more cost-effective avenue for reaching potential leads when compared to Google.
