# Advertising market
The concept of advertising dates back to early human history when people started to trade assets between local communities. Merchants used signs and symbols to advertise their good and more advanced civilizations like the Egyptians used papyrus to make sales posters. The concept of advertising, even though many years have elapsed since its origin, it stayed relatively the same, but the medium has dramatically changed.

In marketing it’s possible to highlight a trend: or one’s adapt to new advertising standards or one is out. In the past 20 years we saw a transition from TV commercials, massive outdoors and other physical media to the digital world. Nowadays, top concerns in advertising are user data handling, user immersion and some other user friendly policies, so in short, now the market is strongly user-centered.
